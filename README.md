# JetsonNano-ROS2-PX4-Holybro-X500-V2
A repository for all things related to the integration and use of the Jetson Nano, ROS2 Foxy, the PX4-6C flight controller, and the holybrox500-v2.

This project is aimed at using the above hardware to locate an aruco marker and land on a platform attached to said aruco marker. Later on this platform will ideally
use wireless charging as well as be attached to a Boston Dynamics Spot Robot.

All files needed, packages used, and steps taken for this project will be kept in this repository.
